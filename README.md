# Online Courses

This is a meta repository to help navigate to my personal repositories for various courses I've taken or created.

## My Courses

I created a course on DataCamp designed as a 2 hour introduction to R for graduate students in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (CBB) at Yale. This course is intended for students who know the basics of programming but have no (or limited) experience using R.
